# Hey, I'm Rob 👋


I ship complex software.  Network simulation, distributed systems, AI infra at data center scale.

Before I ran programs, I wrote them (C++, C#, MATLAB, APIs on Azure/SAP). I still like to stay close to the code.





### Background

I started coding with mIRCScript when I was 12. After that, almost 20 years professionally across SaaS, startups, and infra software. Started as a developer, grew into program leadership. Penn State IST.
